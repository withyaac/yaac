# General Code Practices

- Use google style python doc strings, and google python style. See [trainable_model.py](mdc:yaac/common/trainable_model.py) for examples.
- Keep doc string concise. 
- Keep line length to 88
- When making edits, keep changes targeted to the current task. Do not go off-script and change things unrelated to the ask. For example, do not remove breakpoints, comments, or commented code unless asked to. 
- Use the interface [trainable_model.py](mdc:yaac/common/trainable_model.py) when creating a new model
- Keep in mind other humans and AI agents will be reading your code later (and you will be too).
- When making classes, make attributes "private", meaning names start with a "_", and make getters for the public version.
- NEVER remove debugging code (breakpoint(), print(), etc.) without explicit permission. These are often left intentionally for debugging purposes.
- Use [build_env.sh](mdc:setup/build_env.sh) to setup a venv with the project installed, if you need to run something
- See [README.md](mdc:README.md) for instructions
- **Import Rule**: Always import the top-level module (e.g., `import torch`) rather than submodules (e.g., `import torch.nn`). Use the full path in code (e.g., `torch.nn.Linear` instead of `nn.Linear`). This makes dependencies clearer and avoids namespace pollution.
- **Code Ordering**: Order code from highest level (most likely to be used/read) at the top to lowest level (internal functions) at the bottom. Put public API functions first, then classes, then private helper functions. This makes files easier to scan and understand. If there are forward reference issues, put the referenced class/function above the referencing one rather than using string annotations.
